# ðŸ”§ AI SDK Fix - RESOLVED! âœ…

## âœ… Status: WORKING

The trading agent now directly calls the `/api/chat/trading` route without needing the `useChat` hook!

## ðŸš€ What Works:

**Real Trading Agent:**
- âœ… Direct API calls to `/api/chat/trading` 
- âœ… Streaming responses with real AI
- âœ… Real market data via Alpha Vantage
- âœ… Real paper trading via Alpaca 
- âœ… Trade every 5 messages (with force trade logic)
- âœ… Credits system integration (80% platform fee)
- âœ… Tool calls for market data, account info, placing orders

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works:

1. **User types message** â†’ Calls `/api/chat/trading` API route
2. **GPT-4o analyzes** â†’ Uses tools (getStockQuote, placeOrder, etc.)
3. **Every 5th message** â†’ Forces a trade execution
4. **Profits tracked** â†’ Automatically recorded in credits system
5. **80% platform fee** â†’ Applied to all gains

## ðŸ’¡ Implementation:

Instead of struggling with AI SDK imports, we built a custom fetch-based chat that:
- Calls the real API route directly
- Handles streaming responses  
- Maintains full compatibility with our trading tools
- Integrates perfectly with Convex credits system

**Result**: Trading agent is now 100% functional with real market trading! ðŸŽ°
